# Mind Archive

Mind Archive is a personal repository dedicated to preserving thoughts, reflections, and imagined stories. It serves as a written record of inner dialogue, creative exploration, and narrative experiments.

This repository is not focused on polished literature alone, but on the process of thinking, imagining, and questioning—capturing ideas as they form and evolve.

## Purpose
