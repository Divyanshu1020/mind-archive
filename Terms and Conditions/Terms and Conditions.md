## **Character: Akhraeth**

**The Fracture of Judgment**
Born in the pits of Hell but bound by Heaven’s red tape, Akhraeth is a "Tourist Demon." He cannot corrupt, kill, or steal souls without a signature. He operates on a terrifying loophole: he doesn't create evil; he simply amplifies the hatred already rotting inside a human heart. To the Heavens, it looks like humans are just destroying themselves.

## **Terms and Conditions**

### **The Final Record**

The blue light of the laptop screen was the only thing keeping the darkness at bay. Arjun Malhotra sat motionless. His eyes, once sharp and analytical, were now hollow pits.

"They say the system protects the innocent," Arjun whispered to the webcam. His voice didn't shake; it was worse. It was flat. "It doesn’t. It protects the convincing."

He looked at the empty pill bottles on the desk. He had followed every rule, paid every tax, and loved a woman who used those very rules to strip him of his savings, his dignity, and his child.

"Maybe silence is fairer than justice," he muttered, swallowing the last of the pills. He leaned back, waiting for the world to fade.

### **The Shadow in the Room**

*Click.*

The sound was tiny, but in the silence of the room, it felt like a gunshot. Behind the locked door stood a man. He wore a charcoal suit so perfectly tailored it looked like a second skin. He had no shadow.

Arjun tried to gasp, but his lungs were frozen. He couldn't blink. He couldn't even twitch a finger.

"Relax," the stranger said, his voice like silk over gravel. "Hallucinations are usually much messier than this. I prefer clarity."

The man—Akhraeth—stepped forward, his feet never quite touching the floor. "You hated them so quietly, Arjun. Most humans are loud and boring. But your hatred? It’s refined. It’s heavy."

### **The Loophole**

Akhraeth leaned in, his eyes shimmering with a dull, hellish light. "You worshipped their God. You trusted their Truth. So tell me… why did you lose, and they win?"

Arjun’s mind screamed, but only a broken whisper escaped his lips. "Nothing… comes free. What do you want? My soul?"

Akhraeth paused. A soul? That involved far too much paperwork with the 'Big Boss' upstairs. "Keep your soul," the demon smiled. "What can you actually offer?"

Arjun’s thoughts were a chaotic blur. *Money? I have nothing left but a few thousand in a dead account.* "Money," he choked out.

Akhraeth laughed. It was a genuine, delighted sound. "Perfect. I don't need wealth, but justice requires a price. Punishment must be proportional."

### **The Contract**

"The more you offer, the deeper the justice spreads," Akhraeth explained, pacing the small room. "I will punish everyone you carry hatred for.

He made it sound so reasonable. So fair.

Then, the room snapped back to normal. The demon was gone. The door was still locked.


## **Chapter 2: The Fine Print of Justice**

Morning arrived with a terrifying, absolute silence.

Arjun opened his eyes. There was no grogginess, no chemical burn in his throat from the pills, and no regret. He felt light—not the lightness of joy, but the lightness of an empty shell. The medicine bottle on the desk was dry. The cash he had frantically withdrawn from the ATM last night was gone from the table.

*It was a dream,* he thought. *It had to be.*

He pressed a hand to his chest. His heart rate didn't speed up. He didn't feel the rush of adrenaline or the warmth of satisfaction.

He felt... nothing.

Then, his phone shivered against the wood. It was Rohan, his only remaining friend.

"Arjun? God, you’re awake," Rohan’s voice was frantic, breathless. "Turn on the news. Now."

### **The Global Awakening**

The television screen flickered to life, bleeding crimson from a "Breaking News" banner:

**[GLOBAL SLEEP DISORDER: THE HUNDRED-YEAR NIGHTMARE]**

A reporter stood outside a major hospital, her eyes darting nervously. "It began four hours ago. Across every time zone, people who fall asleep are entering what doctors call a 'Locked-In Terror State.' They don't die, but they don't truly wake up."

A neurologist appeared on a split-screen, pointing to a brain scan that looked like it was on fire.

"The victims experience a total sensory overload," the doctor explained. "Exactly sixty minutes of sleep feels like decades of subjective time. In that hour, they are forced to relive their deepest, most visceral fears for what feels like a lifetime. Then, they snap awake."

"And when they do wake?" the reporter asked.

The doctor’s voice dropped. "They are... broken. Their minds can't reconcile a lifetime of torture with a one-hour nap. But the true horror is the cycle. The moment they close their eyes again, the sixty-minute clock resets. The nightmare starts over from second one. They are trapped in a loop where they cannot sleep, yet they cannot stay awake. They are being tortured by their own biology."

"And how many people are affected?" the reporter asked.

The doctor’s voice dropped. "Not everyone, but still many."

"And how long will it last?" the reporter asked.

The doctor’s voice dropped. "Until the last person dies."

"And what causes it?" the reporter asked.

The doctor’s voice dropped. "The same thing that causes you to dream."

### **The Weight of the List**

Arjun watched, mesmerized. Then, the faces started appearing.

The screen showed **Justice R. Mehta**, the man who had smugly dismissed Arjun’s evidence, being carried out of his mansion on a stretcher. He was clawing at his own eyes, screaming about "the weight of the books."

Then came **Maya**, his ex-wife.

She was caught on a bystander’s phone video, huddled in the corner of her luxury apartment, sobbing to a police officer that the walls were whispering her own lies back to her.

Arjun felt a cold, hard stone settle in his stomach.

*It worked,* he thought. *They’re paying.*

But then, the news feed shifted. It wasn't just them. A famous social media influencer. A high school teacher from his hometown. A delivery driver who had once been rude to him in a parking lot.

### **The Unseen Observer**

The reports grew stranger.

"Every victim who regained consciousness tells the same story," the reporter said, her voice trembling. "They say they weren't alone in their nightmares. They saw a man."

"A man in a black suit?" the news anchor asked.

"Yes. But they say he didn't touch them. He just watched. Some victims claim he was holding something... a small, glowing shape that looked like a human heart. He told them the same thing: *'This was a gift from a friend.'*"

---

### **The Hollow Victory**

Arjun turned off the TV.

The silence returned, heavier than before. He pressed a hand to his chest. His heart rate didn't speed up. He didn't feel the rush of adrenaline or the warmth of satisfaction.

He felt... nothing.

He realized then that Akhraeth hadn't just taken his money. To power a curse of this magnitude, the demon had used Arjun’s own capacity for feeling as the battery.

"I only wanted justice," Arjun whispered to the empty room.

The words felt hollow. They were factual, like a line of code in a broken system. Outside, a car drifted into a pole as the driver succumbed to the sleep. A scream echoed from the hallway.

Somewhere, in a place without shadows, Akhraeth was likely checking his watch, waiting for the next "Terms and Conditions" to be signed.
