## Fictional Character

### Name: **Akhraeth**

*(Derived from “Akhra” = fracture, “Raeth” = judgment)*

### Nature

* Born in Hell, but **not allowed to corrupt free will directly**
* Cannot kill, possess, or coerce humans
* Cannot take souls **without explicit consent**
* God’s rule: *“No punishment without human invocation.”*

### Loophole He Exploits

Akhraeth **does not punish people directly**.
He **amplifies hatred already present in a human heart** and lets the hatred punish the world.

To Heaven, it looks like:

> “Humans destroying humans by their own emotions.”

So God does not intervene.

### Motivation

Akhraeth is bored.
Hell is predictable. Earth is chaotic.
He doesn’t want souls — **he wants reactions**.

## Human Character

### Name: **Arjun Malhotra**

* Mid-30s
* Former systems analyst
* Believed in law, structure, fairness
* Destroyed by a **fabricated court case**
* Wife used the system perfectly:

  * False accusations
  * Legal delay
  * Social character assassination
* Lost:

  * His savings
  * His reputation
  * Custody of his child
  * His faith — quietly, without drama

His final hatred is not rage — **it is exhaustion**.

## Short Story

### *“Terms and Conditions”*

## Core Theme (What This Story Is Really About)

* Justice systems don’t fail randomly — they fail **structurally**
* Hatred is never contained
* Revenge doesn’t target — **it spreads**
* Demons don’t create evil — **they monetize it**
