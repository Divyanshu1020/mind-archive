## Chapter 2 — Children Wearing Power

They attacked together.

And fell together.

The man moved with no urgency, no fury. He disarmed, redirected, humiliated. Not to prove dominance—but because resistance bored him.

Arin moves like this isn’t a battle
but a chore he’s done too many times.

He disarms one. Breaks another. Throws one god into another god.

Children fighting a storm.

Then the boss arrived.

Tailored suit. Controlled fury. A weapon that bent air itself.

“What have you done to my people?” the boss demanded.

“I showed mercy,” the man replied. “Something you forgot when you took my life.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” the boss said.
“But you won’t leave this place in one piece.”

The boss attacked.

The man blocked.

Walls collapsed. Floors shattered.

“No more mercy.” the boss said.

The boss attacked again.

The man blocked again.

Furious and desperate, the man broke his arm, kicked him down, and raised his sword.

The Interruption arrived.

Two fingers stopped the blade.

“That’s enough,” said a calm voice.

Even the man paused.
