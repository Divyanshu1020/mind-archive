# **THE ONE WHO WALKED BACK**
## Chapter 1 — The Gate Where Gods Pretend to Rule

The sky did not open with thunder.

It folded.

A man descended at the entrance of the Council Tower—a structure of glass, steel, and arrogance suspended above the clouds. The ground beneath him did not shatter. It bent, as if recognizing something older than authority.

The guards froze.

They knew who he was.

Not by name.
By consequence.

No warning was given.

A single shot rang out.

Far above, the storm-bearing executive—one of the highest—fell lifeless in his office. No lightning answered him. No miracle followed.

Only silence.

The man walked forward.

Weapons were raised.

He passed through them as if they were thoughts—present, but irrelevant.

Inside the tower, the main gate exploded inward.

Smoke. Screams. Panic.

He stepped through the dust, dragging a god by the head. Alive. Broken. Whimpering.

“I could end you,” the man said calmly.
Then he released him.
“But pain remembers better than death.”

He looked around at the gathered immortals.

“Where is your boss?”

Murmurs spread.

A human.
Standing equal.
Unafraid.
