## The Question That Crossed the Gates

The warrior lost something the world could not return.
Not a weapon.
Not a name.

A life bound to his by marriage.
Taken so precisely it felt planned.

He searched for meaning where widows usually search for mercy.
He found none.

When he realized her death aligned too cleanly with prophecy,
he stopped praying.

Mercy died with her.

The warrior crossed not with rage,
but with a single demand:

*Who wrote this destiny?*



This is not a war story.
It is a record of what happens when a man asks gods
to explain their handwriting.

Read carefully.
Some answers punish the one who hears them.
