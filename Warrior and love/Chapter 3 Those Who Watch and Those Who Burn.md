Arin freezes.

Boss panics “He tried to kill me!”


“You’re immortal. You’ll survive.” The Calm One said.

The Calm One turns to Arin spoke gently.

“Tell me what happened, child.”

The man lowered his sword.

“I loved her. I married her. She died.”

Later, he learned the truth.

Her destiny had been written to end the moment she married the one she loved.

“I want to know,” the man said, “who writes something like that.”

“You came to the wrong one,” the Calm One replied. “Wait here.”

Behind the veil of reality, the Calm One spoke with the Ash-Marked One.

Ash-Marked One:"How's your finger?"

The Calm One:"Small scratch."

Ash-Marked One:"From a human?"
(chuckles)
"Impressive."

The Calm One:"He put everything into that strike."

Ash-Marked One:"Why didn't you stop him sooner?"

The Calm One:"Why didn't you?"

Ash-Marked One:"I saw myself in him."
"Fighting for love."

The Calm One nods.

The Calm One:
"Then let's talk to the one who wrote it."

The Calm One looks upward.

The Calm One:
"The Architect."
